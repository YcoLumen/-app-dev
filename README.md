# Insidious

*Stretching the idea of astral projection to its furthest point, Insidious creates the terrifying reality of being removed from one's own body. Even if you don't think in astral projection, it's sad and unsettling to see a comatose person's lifeless body, especially if it's a child. Insidious is a series of American horror films created by Leigh Whannell. The films in the franchise include, Insidious, Insidious: Chapter 2, Insidious: Chapter 3, Insidious: The Last Key and Insidious: The Red Door. The films have grossed over $542 million worldwide on a combined budget of $26.5 million.*
